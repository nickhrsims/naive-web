# Naive

NAIVE is a web application visualization tool that will be used to communicate, aggregate and visualize data gathered during network assessments. The project will utilize many organizational techniques to properly display information, with customization features available. Given an INVA/DE Rollup, this project will comb through the data, organize, then visualize.

Made with :heart: using ReactJS, CRA4, React Router DOM, and ChakraUI.
